# Lesson 1: Hello World

**Time**: 2 minutes
**Difficulty**: Beginner

## 🎯 Goal

Write your first Jounce program and see it run in real-time!

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Delete the TODO comment** in the code editor
2. **Type**: `console.log("Hello, Jounce!");`
3. **Click "Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter) to see the output

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- How to use the code editor
- How to write basic Jounce code
- How to see output in the console
- The instant feedback loop

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run your code, you should see this in the console:

```
Hello, Jounce!
```

## 🎓 Concept: Console Logging

`console.log()` is a built-in function that prints messages to the console. It's perfect for:
- Debugging your code
- Seeing what values your variables hold
- Checking if your code is running

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

After completing this lesson, try:
- Printing a different message
- Using multiple `console.log()` statements
- Printing numbers: `console.log(42);`

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Error: Unexpected token**
→ Make sure you have both opening and closing quotes: `"Hello, Jounce!"`

**Nothing appears in console**
→ Make sure you clicked "Run" or pressed Ctrl+Enter

**Syntax error**
→ Check that you have a semicolon at the end: `;`

## ➡️ Next Lesson

Great job! 🎉 In the next lesson, you'll learn about **variables and signals** - the foundation of reactive programming in Jounce.
