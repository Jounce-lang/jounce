# Quick Start Guide

**This document has been replaced.**

Please see:
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** for the Quick Start guide
- **[LEARN_JOUNCE.md](./LEARN_JOUNCE.md)** for tutorials
- **[JOUNCE_SPEC.md](../../JOUNCE_SPEC.md)** for technical reference

## Why was this moved?

As part of the v0.8.3 documentation cleanup, we established three "golden docs":

1. **[README.md](../../README.md)** - "Hey, here's Jounce, install it, look at this counter"
2. **[LEARN_JOUNCE.md](./LEARN_JOUNCE.md)** - "Here's how to be productive"
3. **[JOUNCE_SPEC.md](../../JOUNCE_SPEC.md)** - "This is the truth"

All quick start content is now in README.md to eliminate duplication.
